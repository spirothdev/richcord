# Discord GameSDK `libs` directory
This is where the imported libraries reside provided by Discord GameSDK.

## How to get them?
Get Discord GameSDK [here](https://dl-game-sdk.discordapp.net/3.2.1/discord_game_sdk.zip), then you copy the contents of `lib/x86_64`
and paste it in this directory.

*Note: If your machine is 32-bit, use `x86` instead of `x86_64`*

*Warning: The latest version of Discord GameSDK supports the `aarch64` (or ARM64) architecture, but it is not recommended to compile Richcord on it.*
